just homepage stuff

To do:
Steam model:
-change the csgo_stats(), l4d2_stats(), and tf2_stats() to simply call a new generic function passing their individual elements as arguements. Currently some repeated code.
-change the function that searches the object returned from steam. Currently it searches for keys in the object and returns them. I loop through an array of keys and search for each. The function should accept the array instead of individual keys and handle it all itself. (imo)

Blog:
-add a proper ui for writing new blog posts and maybe add comment functionality so I can be harrassed by visitors.

Music:
-do something more interesting. Maybe a feature where people submit their last.fm username and I suggest gigs we could attend together.
