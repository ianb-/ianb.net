	<h1>Stats From Games</h1>
	<p>When I found out there was a wealth of information stored about my gaming history, I really wanted to do something interesting with these stats. 
		It turns out it isn't really all that interesting, but I've done something anyway. For these Valve games there are hundreds of different statistics, 
		but I've chosen just a few seemed the most relevent.</p>
	<p>If you wish you can search for your own stats in comparison to mine. This requires your steamid64, which you can either find as the 17 numerical character string 
		in your steamcommunity profile url. Unless you have selected a custom url. Or there are tools to find your steamid64 on the internet.
