	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
		So here's a website.<br>
		I made this one with CodeIgniter, since it had been a while since I'd used php.<br>
		I made a <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://poj.ianb.net">fake shop</a> using Django. 
		Which was fun. I liked Python. If you'd like to see the CMS (which was what it was really about), just ask and I shall provide a staff/god level account.
	</p>
	<p>
		I hope it's not too annoying watching the spinners while the data loads. I thought it preferable for the page to render, then start pulling data from Last.fm/Steamworks.
		I guess they're fairly reliable services, but if it can take ~5 seconds or longer to load a page, that probably makes people angrier than seeing the spinning thing.

		Please feel free to send me an email by clicking the envelope below.<br>
		Or add me on steam!
